I hereby attach a draft of the system I would like you to develop for me, pls.

You can use either MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle as the database management system.
The system should be part of a financial management system where branches are in regions and each branch is managed by a manager.
Managers can be transferred from one branch to another and the system should keep the transfer history of the manager.

The system should have the following reports:
List of managers
List managers by gender
List of manager that have been transferred within a given period – e.g. from 1st January 2020 to 30th March 2020.
The reports be on the company letterhead.

The system should be able generate a query like ‘who is the manager in a given branch’?

Dear Mr. Jobarteh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am pleased to inform you that
I have successfully completed the project we discussed, and all the specified requirements have been met.

The project now includes the following enhancements:

1. Printing Functionality Users can now easily generate and
   print records as needed, providing a convenient way to access information.

2. Record Saving: I have added the ability to save records in PDF format. This feature provides users with a versatile and widely compatible format for storing and sharing data.

I have thoroughly tested these new features to ensure their functionality and reliability.
The project is now ready for your review and feedback.

Furthermore, I want to inform you that I am actively working on additional functionalities to further improve the system. One of the upcoming enhancements is the ability to save database records in various formats such as CSV, plain text, or even in Microsoft Word (DOCX) format. This will provide users with more flexibility in managing and exporting data.

I am eager to hear your thoughts on the current state of the project and any feedback you may have. If there are specific aspects you would like to discuss or any further adjustments required, please do not hesitate to let me know.

I appreciate the trust and opportunity you have given me to work on this project. Once again thank you for your time and consideration.
